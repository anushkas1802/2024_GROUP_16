This project represents a collaborative effort to integrate Virtual Reality (VR) rendering capabilities into a software application, enhancing its user interface and functionality. The project involved the development of a multi-\/threaded application, leveraging Qt for the primary GUI and VTK for 3D rendering and VR integration. The application allows users to interact with 3D models and visualize data within a VR environment.\hypertarget{index_Team_Members}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Team Members}{Team Members}}\label{index_Team_Members}
