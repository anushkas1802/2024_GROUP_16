\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Implementation of the \doxylink{class_model_part}{Model\+Part} class, which represents a node in a hierarchical model structure. 

This class manages hierarchical data items typically used in model tree structures. It includes support for VTK-\/based STL model visualization and coloring. The class can store a list of child parts, assign parent-\/child relationships, store metadata, and manage 3D actor representation including color and visibility.
