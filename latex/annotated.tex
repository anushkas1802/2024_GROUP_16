\doxysection{Class List}
Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_main_window}{Main\+Window}} \\*The \doxylink{class_main_window}{Main\+Window} class. This class defines the main window of the application, responsible for the user interface, 3D rendering using VTK, and interaction with the VR rendering thread }{\pageref{class_main_window}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_model_part}{Model\+Part}} }{\pageref{class_model_part}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_model_part_list}{Model\+Part\+List}} \\*Model to represent a list of 3D model parts in a tree structure }{\pageref{class_model_part_list}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_option_dialog}{Option\+Dialog}} \\*Dialog for setting object properties }{\pageref{class_option_dialog}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_v_r_render_thread}{VRRender\+Thread}} \\*This class inherits from the Qt class QThread which allows it to be a parallel thread to the \doxylink{main_8cpp_a0ddf1224851353fc92bfbff6f499fa97}{main()} thread, and also from vtk\+Command which allows it to act as a "{}callback"{} for the vtk\+Render\+Window\+Interactor. This callback functionallity means that once the render\+Window\+Interactor takes control of this thread to enable VR, it can callback to a function in the class to check to see if the user has requested any changes }{\pageref{class_v_r_render_thread}}{}
